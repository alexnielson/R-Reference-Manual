This function is preferable to c() when creating an empty vector, according to the DataCamp article “Five Tips to Improve Your R Code”. Matrix base matrix(): Create a matrix. Array base array(): Create an array. List base c(): Combine values into a vector or list. list(): Create a list. tibble tibble(): Create a data frame or list. Data Frame base data.frame(): Create a data frame. Prefer tibble::tibble() over base::data.frame(). list(): Create a list. tibble tibble(): Create a data frame or list. References “Vectors” (Grolemund &amp; Wickham, R for Data Science) “Data structures” (Wickham, Advanced R) Other stats rnorm(): Generate a random normal distribution. Import Data from a Local Drive base attach(): Attach a set of R objects to the search path. Allows objects in the database to be accessed by giving their names (e.g., height rather than women$height). file.choose(): Choose a file interactively. Use as file = file.choose() in read.table() and similar functions. load(): Reload datasets saved with save(). readRDS(): Restore an R object written with saveRDS(). data.table fread(): Similar to read.table(), but faster and more convenient for large data sets. foreign read.spss(): Read an SPSS data file. haven read_sas(): Read and write SAS files. readr read_delim(): Read a delimited (including csv and txv) file. Child functions: read_csv(), read_csv2(), read_tsv(). readxl excel_sheets(): List all sheets in an Excel spreadsheet. read_excel(): Read xls and xlsx files. Child functions: read_xls(), read_xlsx() utils data(): Load specified data sets, or list the available data sets. Use this function to load the data sets that accompany R packages, such as openintro’s hsb2 and email50 and gapminder’s gapminder. read.table(): Read a file in table format. Child functions: read.csv(), read.csv2(), read.delim(), read.delim2(). XLConnect readWorksheetFromFile(): Read data from worksheets in an Excel file. Import Data from the Internet {httr} GET: Get a URL. {jsonlite} read_json: Read and write JSON. {readr} read_csv: Read a comma separated value file into a tibble. read_csv2: Read a semi-colon separated value file into a tibble. read_delim: Read a delimited file into a tibble. read_tsv: Read a tab separated value file into a tibble. {rjson} fromJSON: Convert JSON to R. {utils} download.file: Download a file from the Internet. Example: Multiple files in the same link url_rdata &lt;- &quot;https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/236/datasets/7f714f993f1ad4c3d26412ae1e537ce6355b1b54/iris.RData&quot; download.file(url_rdata, destfile = &quot;datacamp.Rdata&quot;) load(&quot;datacamp.Rdata&quot;) unzip: Extract or list zip archives. Example: download.file( &quot;https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/1069/datasets/578834f5908e3b2fa575429a287586d1eaeb2e54/countries2.zip&quot;, destfile = &quot;Data Sets/Countries&quot;, mode = &quot;wb&quot;) unzip(&quot;Data Sets/Countries&quot;, exdir = &quot;Data Sets&quot;) Import Data from a Database DBI dbBind(): Bind values to a parameterized/prepared statement. dbClearResult(): Free all resources (local and remote) associated with a result set. dbConnect(): Connect to a DBMS. dbDataType(): Determine the SQL data type of an object. dbDisconnect(): Disconnect (close) a connection to a DBMS. dbFetch(): Fetch records from a previously executed query. dbGetQuery(): Send query, retrieve the results, and then clear result set. dbListTables(): List remote tables. dbReadTable(): Copy data frames to and from database tables. dbSendQuery(): Execute a query on a given database connection. dbSendStatement(): Execute a data manipulation statement on a given database connection. Reference Material The openintro package contains data sets useful for practicing and teaching. "]

Allows objects in the database to be accessed by giving their names (e.g., height rather than women$height). file.choose: Choose a file interactively. Use as file = file.choose() inside a data import function (such as read_csv and readRDS). load: Reload datasets saved with save(). readRDS: Restore an R object written with saveRDS(). {data.table} fread: Similar to read.table, but faster and more convenient for large data sets. {foreign} read.spss: Read an SPSS data file. {haven} read_sas: Read and write SAS files. {readr} read_csv: Read a comma separated value file into a tibble. read_csv2: Read a semi-colon separated value file into a tibble. read_delim: Read a delimited file into a tibble. read_tsv: Read a tab separated value file into a tibble. {readxl} excel_sheets: List all sheets in an Excel spreadsheet. read_excel: Read xls and xlsx files. read_xls: Read a .xls file. read_xlsx: Read a .xlsx file. {utils} data: Load specified data sets, or list the available data sets. Use this function to load the data sets that accompany R packages, such as openintro’s hsb2 and email50 and gapminder’s gapminder. read.csv: Read a .csv file. read.csv2: Read semi-colon separated value file. read.delim: Read a delimited file. read.delim2: Read a delimited file where the decimal point is a comma. read.table: Read a file in table format. {XLConnect} readWorksheetFromFile: Read data from worksheets in an Excel file. Import Data from the Internet {httr} GET: Get a URL. {jsonlite} read_json: Read and write JSON. {readr} read_csv: Read a comma separated value file into a tibble. read_csv2: Read a semi-colon separated value file into a tibble. read_delim: Read a delimited file into a tibble. read_tsv: Read a tab separated value file into a tibble. {rjson} fromJSON: Convert JSON to R. {utils} download.file: Download a file from the Internet. Example: download.file( &quot;https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/5028/datasets/a55843f83746968c7f118d82ed727db9c71e891f/snake_river_visits.rds&quot;, destfile = paste0(getwd(), &quot;/Snake River Visits.rds&quot;)) snake_river_visits &lt;- readRDS(file.choose()) # or path &lt;- paste0(getwd(), &quot;/Snake River Visits.rds&quot;) snake_river_visits &lt;- readRDS(path) Example: Rdata files # Example 1: download.file( &quot;https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/236/datasets/7f714f993f1ad4c3d26412ae1e537ce6355b1b54/iris.RData&quot;, destfile = &quot;datacamp_iris_dataset.Rdata&quot;) load(&quot;datacamp_iris_dataset.Rdata&quot;) # Example 2: download.file( &quot;https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/235/datasets/3b6fc2923b599058584b57d8c605c6bef454d273/CHIS2009_reduced_2.Rdata&quot;, destfile = &quot;chis_2009.Rdata&quot;, # The documentation for `download.file` indicates that the function will # automatically include `mode = &quot;wb&quot;` for .Rdata files. That may have happened # in Example 1, but didn&#39;t happen in Example 2, which is why I&#39;ve included it. mode = &quot;wb&quot;) load(&quot;chis_2009.Rdata&quot;) unzip: Extract or list zip archives. Example: download.file( &quot;https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/1069/datasets/578834f5908e3b2fa575429a287586d1eaeb2e54/countries2.zip&quot;, destfile = &quot;Data Sets/Countries&quot;, mode = &quot;wb&quot;) unzip(&quot;Data Sets/Countries&quot;, exdir = &quot;Data Sets&quot;) Import Data from a Database DBI dbBind(): Bind values to a parameterized/prepared statement. dbClearResult(): Free all resources (local and remote) associated with a result set. dbConnect(): Connect to a DBMS. dbDataType(): Determine the SQL data type of an object. dbDisconnect(): Disconnect (close) a connection to a DBMS. dbFetch(): Fetch records from a previously executed query. dbGetQuery(): Send query, retrieve the results, and then clear result set. dbListTables(): List remote tables. dbReadTable(): Copy data frames to and from database tables. dbSendQuery(): Execute a query on a given database connection. dbSendStatement(): Execute a data manipulation statement on a given database connection.

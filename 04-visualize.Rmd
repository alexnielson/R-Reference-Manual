# Visualize

***
"Visualisation is a fundamentally human activity. A good visualisation will show you things that you did not expect, or raise new questions about the data. A good visualisation might also hint that you're asking the wrong question, or you need to collect different data. Visualisations can surprise you, but don't scale particularly well because they require a human to interpret them."

## Plots

`base`

* `abline()`: Add straight lines to a plot.
* `plot()`: Generic X-Y plotting.
* `points()`: Add points to a plot.

`ggbeeswarm`

* `geom_beeswarm()`: Create a beeswarm plot.

`ggplot2`

* `aes()`: Construct aesthetic mappings.
    + Arguments include `color`, `fill`, `size`, `labels`, `alpha`, `shape` (1-20 accept color attributes and 21-25 accept color and fill attributes), `linewidth`, `linetype`.
    + Use `?pch` to see options for `shape`.
    + The default shape for points does not have a `fill` attribute, which means that mapping a categorical variable onto `fill` won't result in multiple colors.
    + Helper functions to include in the call when needing to modify the data include: `stats::reorder()`.
* `coord_*()`
    + `coord_cartesian()`: Zoom a plot in or out without changing the underlying data.
    + `coord_flip()`: Flip the x and y axes.
    + `coord_polar()`: Used to convert a stacked bar chart to a pie chart.
* `geom_*()`: Create a geometry.
    + Note that `aes()` can be called within `geom_*()` rather than prior to.
    + `geom_abline()`: Add reference lines to a plot.
        + Child functions: `geom_hline()`, `geom_vline()`.
    + `geom_bar()`: Create a bar chart, where the height of the bar is proportional to the number of cases in each group.
    + `geom_boxplot()`: Create a boxplot.
    + `geom_col()`: Create a bar chart, where the height of the bar represents values in the data.
    + `geom_density()`: Create a kernal density estimate (a smoothed version of a histogram).
        + Consider using `geom_rug()` with `geom_density()` in order to be transparent about smoothed data.
    + `geom_dotplot()`: Create a histogram out of dots.
    + `geom_histogram()`: Create a histogram.
        + Use `y = stat(density)` to rescale the y-axis from counts to a probability estimate.
    + `geom_jitter()`: Jitter points.
        + Useful with `geom_boxplot()`.
    + `geom_path()`: Connect observations in the order in which they appear.
    + `geom_point()`: Create a scatterplot (a.k.a. point chart or dot plot).
    + `geom_rug()`: Create a ruge plot in the margin.
        + Useful with `geom_density()`.
    + `geom_smooth()`: Smoothed conditional means; aids the eye in seeing patterns in the presence of overplotting.
    + `geom_text()`: Add text directly to the plot.
    + `geom_violin()`: Create a violin plot.
* `ggplot()`: Create a plot.
* `facet_grid()`: Lay out panels in a grid.
* `facet_wrap()`: Wrap a 1D ribbon of panels into 2D (observe a variable, conditional on another variable).
* `labs()`: Modify axis, legend, and plot labels.
    + Child functions: `xlab()`, `ylab()`, `ggtitle()`.
* `position_*()`:
    + `position_identity()`: Don't adjust position.
    + `position_dodge()`: Dodge overlapping objects side-to-side.
    + `position_nudge()`: Nudge points a fixed distance.
    + `position_stack()`: Stack overlapping objects on top of each other, as counts.
    + `position_fill()`: Stack overlapping objects on top of each other, as densities.
    + `position_jitter()`: Jitter points to avoid overplotting.
    + `position_jitterdodge()`: Simultaneously dodge and jitter.
* `scale_*_*()`:
    + `scale_x_*()`
    + `scale_y_*()`
    + `scale_color_*()`
    + `scale_fill_*()`
    + `scale_shape_*()`
    + `scale_linetype_*()`

`ggridges`

* `geom_density_ridges()`: Create a ridgeline plot.

`graphics`

* `boxplot()`: Create a box-and-whisker plot.
* `hist()`: Create a histogram.
* 'stripchart()`: One dimensional scatter plots.
    + Preferable to `ggplot()` when creating one-dimensional plots.

`grDevices`

* `colorRamp()`: Color interpolation.
    + `colorRampPalette()`

`RColorBrewer`

* `brewer.pal()`: Make the ColorBrewer color palettes available as R palattes.

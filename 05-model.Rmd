# Model

***
"Models are complementary tools to visualisation. Once you have made your questions sufficiently precise, you can use a model to answer them. Models are a fundamentally mathematical or computational tool, so they generally scale well. ... But every model makes assumptions, and by its very nature a model cannot question its own assumptions. That means a model cannot fundamentally surprise you. 
- Garrett Grolemund & Hadley Wickham, *R for Data Science*"

***
## General

`broom`

* `tidy()`: Construct a data frame that summarizes the model's statistical findings.
    
`dplyr`

* `sample_n()`: Sample n rows from a table.
    
`stats`

* `coef()`: Extract model coefficients.
* `cor()`: Correlation, variance, and covariance (matrices).
    + Child functions: `var()`, `cov()`, and `cov2cor()`.

***
## Regression

`stats`

* `df.residual()`: Get the residual degrees of freedom.
* `lm()`: Fit linear models.
* `residuals()`: Extract model residuals.

***
## Simulation & Prediction

`base`

* `set.seed()`: Random number generation.

`stats`

* `predict()`: Model prediction.
    + Use with "lm" class objects and new data to predict new values (e.g., `predict(model, newdata)`).
* `rnorm()`: Generate a normal distribution.
